# Customer Segmentation (Retail)

### Background

This series of notebook will focus on a  predictive maintenance problem competition. The business challenge is brought by www.drivendata.org and the goal is to  predict the operation state (functional, repair needed, complete failure) of water pumps in Tanzania. The water pump data is provided by taarifa.org an organization that provides people the ability to report water and sanitation problems in Africa. Here is a dashboard of the status of water points in Tanzania: http://dashboard.taarifa.org/#/dashboard.</br>

### Business Objectives
Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, we will be trying to predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all. Prediction will be based on on a number of variables:  what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed etc. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania</br>
